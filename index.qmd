### **ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to The Data Sketchbook**

I am a computational scientist with a focus on data science. I started this blog to document my learnings related to data visualization and causal AI. Some posts feature reproductions of visualizations from [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/) and insights from books I am studying, such as [*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*](https://shorturl.at/2MEDn) and [*Effective Visualization*](https://shorturl.at/ClxpM).

Recently, I took a break from the industry to explore the use of LLMs in Automated Program Repair and Software Engineering education at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). You can find the report [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09694).

Previously, I worked on developing medical risk prediction models and conducted research in computational neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute.
