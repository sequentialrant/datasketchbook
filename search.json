    "text": "👋 Welcome to The Data Sketchbook\nI am a computational scientist with a focus on data science. I started this blog to document my learnings related to data visualization and causal AI. Some posts feature reproductions of visualizations from Flowing Data and insights from books I am studying, such as The Visual Display of Quantitative Information and Effective Visualization.\nRecently, I took a break from the industry to explore the use of LLMs in Automated Program Repair and Software Engineering education at SUTD. You can find the report here.\nPreviously, I worked on developing medical risk prediction models and conducted research in computational neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute.\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTitle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 21, 2025\n\n\nSingapore Population Pyramid (1970-2024)\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

In later years, the older age groups occupy a larger share, while the younger age groups appear relatively smaller. This is reflected in the changing shape of the pyramid, with a gradual shift in the distribution across different age categories.\n\n\nSOURCE: DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS, Singapore"
