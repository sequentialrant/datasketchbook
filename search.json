    "text": "When comparing two distinct groups, like Men vs. Women or Product A vs. Product B, the standard bar chart often falls short. It shows you the volume, but it does not always show you the structure.\nEnter the Pyramid Chart.\nAt its core, a pyramid chart is deceptively simple. It is two bar charts joined by a central spine, facing opposite directions. It is the gold standard for demographic data because it allows our eyes to instantly compare the symmetry (or asymmetry) between two groups. But the real magic happens when you animate it.\nA static pyramid chart is a snapshot in time. It tells you what the population looked like in 1990. But data rarely sits still. Populations age, customer bases shift, and trends evolve.\nWhen you apply animation to a pyramid chart over a time axis, you stop looking at bars and start looking at a shifting silhouette.\nSingapore Population Pyramid (1970-2024): Watch how, in the earlier years, the pyramid sits on a wide base, indicating a predominantly young population. As the animation progresses into later years, that base narrows while the upper sections expand. You can literally see the “weight” of the population shift upward as the distribution moves from young to old.\n\n\nSOURCE: DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS, Singapore"
